PART V – TO BE COMPLETED BY OFFICE OF GRADUATE STUDIES Endorsed Comments (if any): Name / Signature: Date: Abstract Introduction: Online shopping scams involve scammers impersonating legitimate online merchants, either through a phony website or a phony advertisement on a legitimate ecommerce platform. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of training on the capability of users to identify online-shopping frauds. We hypothesize that post the training on identification of online shopping fraud attributes, an attentive subject would be able to identify a fraud deal online. Method: The study was conducted with 147 participants across different geographies, age- group and gender. Result: Results in this study provided a review on the effect of training when categorizing deals as fraudulent or legitimate. Our results showed that the capability of spotting a fraudulent deal has improved with the training. Discussion: The connectivism theory, on which our research was based, was successful in our study, as evidenced by the participant's score significantly improving after training. Keywords: online shopping, customer, seller, fraud, e-commerce Acknowledgment The author of this research would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Professor Pieter Hartel and Mr Jaddoo Yeaz Elias for their constant support, guidance and advises throughout the course of this research. The author would also like to thank SUTD Institutional Review Board and Ms Jasmine for their support on this project. Lastly, the author would also like to thank all the participants for the online survey, for taking their time out for participation.

A study on the impact of raised awareness for fraud detection &amp; avoidance is motivating and significant (Lallie et al., 2021). As per the annual report1 of Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), Cybercrime made up 43% of overall crime in 2020, from the same report, it is stated that

                 since 2019. It was a direct outcome of circuit-breaker (lockdown) regulations enforced by the government, online shopping saw a surge of users during the pandemic. It was mainly triggered by the sense of safety associated with online shopping as compared to shopping malls or shops. This surge in the online shoppers also presented an opportunity to the cybercriminals for committing cybercrimes which is very well represented in the crime cases numbers shown in the Figure 1 (Kashif et al., 2020).

In a research conducted on the e-commerce fraud, the researchers studied the impact of knowledge gap between cheater and cheated on the ecommerce platforms and argued that it often leads to e-commerce frauds (Zhang et al., 2018). In this paper, we study the effectiveness of training on the capability of an online-shopper to identify fraud ecommerce deals. We hypothesize that post the training on identification of online shopping fraud attributes, an attentive subject would be able to identify a fraud deal online.

The lure of what appears to be a fantastic deal for a device, clothing, amusement park, or concert ticket marketed online frequently tempts victims of online shopping scams. The victim buyer send money to the cybercriminal posing as a &quot;seller&quot; after being assured that the item will be delivered. After the initial payment is received, some merchants request additional payments for duties or shipping fees. In the end, the victim never gets the good they paid for.

Data was collected from 147 participants through a survey. The participants were selected across different geographies, age-group, professions, and gender. The data collected was further analysed. The participants were presented with a survey link, which constituted of two tests i.e. pre and post training and a training primarily focused on the below pointers to differentiate a legitimate deal from a fraudulent deal: ? Deals that are drastically below market value &amp; are advertised as limited-time offers or flash sales, ? High demand products that are marked down ? Lack of product details or unclear terms and conditions, ? A seller who insists on external bank transfers and refuses to use the ecommerce platform’s payment methods. The online survey presented the participants snapshots of legitimate and fraud online shopping deals on an e-commerce platform (Facebook Marketplace2).

The survey completion timeframe of minimum four &amp; a maximum of thirty minutes was decided during the initial dry-run of the survey, on the basis of inputs gathered from participating volunteers. There were 64 participants from Singapore and 51 from India and 14 participants from other countries were combined as RoW (rest of the world). There were 92 male participants and 35 female participants, the skew in the gender-based participation is an impact of researcher’s network’s effect. Other highlights of the participants are as below: ? Average time spent on the survey was 9 minutes 52 seconds ? 49.6% participation were from the age-group of 35-50 years, followed by 49.3% from 25-35 years, 6.2% from 18-25 years and 3.9% for 50 years and above. ? 49.6% participants were from Singapore, 39.5% from India and 10.9% participants were from rest of the world ? 71.3% participants were male &amp; 27.1% were female ? 58.4% participants were graduates followed by 38.4% post-graduates &amp; above and 3.2% were Diploma. ? 97.7% of participants had heard of online-shopping scams ? 19.4% of participants had been victim of online-shopping scams in past while 80.6% were not victims of fraud before. Material Gathering The fraud shopping snapshots for the survey were gathered using the Singapore Police Force’s portal and by scrapping the online shopping platform, Facebook marketplace. The intent behind having snapshots instead of links to the online-shopping deals was to ensure consistency in the data collection for the survey, as the fraudulent deals are reported and frequently taken down by the hosting platforms. We had chosen the online-deals for the test snapshots after researching on the basis of Singapore police advisories1 on ecommerce scams &amp; National Crime Prevention Council’s scam advisories2.

                / Scoring Pre-Training-Score A sequel of 4 snapshots pointing to fraudulent and legitimate shopping deals were presented to participants asking them to identify snapshot as fraud or legitimate. If classified incorrectly, the test presented them the next snapshot and if participant correctly classification the image, the test further asked them to select a maximum of 2 from 5 options presented which described why the snapshot was classified as fraud or legitimate. Post-Training-Score Similar approach and logics were followed as Pre-training-score with different snapshot of same difficulty scale and order of presentation. After the completion of the post-test users were presented with thank you a message with total pre-training and post-training scores. Survey Tool We have used the Typeform licensed professional version that provides multiple intuitive templates to choose from option for adding logic jumps, scoring method, and linkage to Google spreadsheet to store data. The platform enabled us by making the survey intuitive and engaging. Data clean-up As the survey was hosted on a Software as a Service (SaaS) professional platform, it automatically discarded incomplete surveys and stored data for only completed ones. The research survey was design in such a way that there wasn’t a possibility of getting missing data. A manual visual inspection of the data was performed together with variance check to check for straight-liners and the data was found to be free from straight-liner. Scoring Scenarios The number of questions in the survey were same for all participants. After the declaration of consent and a couple of demographic questions around gender, education, exposure to online shopping fraud, the participants in all groups were presented the first set i.e., pre-test snapshots. Every snapshot carried three marks to one mark i.e., first marks for correctly classifying the snapshot and two marks to spot the attributes that helped the participant to correctly classify the online deal snapshot, one mark was awarded for every correctly spotted attribute and a maximum of two attributes were present in every snapshot. There was a legitimate deal photograph in both sets (pre and post training) which carried only one mark. Every question provided the participants with “need more info” option button that displayed with more information about the product (specifications, condition, location etc) and seller (reviews, rating, location and photograph); the intent of this information was to help the participant with sufficient data to make a justified call on the snapshot’s classification. There was a logic jump involved in the survey i.e., for every snapshot question wrongly answered, the survey jumped to the next snapshot in question directly without asking the users the attributes that may classify the online deal’s snapshot as a potential fraud or legitimate. Post the first four snapshot-based questionnaire, a training followed with slides illustrating different attributes that can be used to spot the fraudulent online deals. Soon after the training, the users repeated the same step as pre-set but with different four online shopping deal snapshots. The maximum score possible was 9 marks for both phases i.e., 9 from pre-training and 9 from post-training. At the end of the survey, the scores were shared with participants. Scoring Scenarios examples are below: Scenario one - fraudulent deal; the participant correctly selects the first snapshot’s first question as fraudulent, they are awarded 1 point of it. The survey proceeds to second part of the first question wherein the participant has to select the attributes that influenced their decision to classify the snapshot as fraudulent deal, if the participant selects the two-right attribute, a maximum of two points will be awarded. Hence a participant with all right answers would score a maximum of three points per question (with fraudulent deal snapshot). Scenario two - fraudulent deal; if the participant selects the snapshot in question as legitimate online deal, they are not presented the second part of the question asking for the attributes and a logic jump takes them to the next question. The participant scores zero points for this question. Scenario three - fraudulent deal; if the participant selects the snapshot in question as fraudulent deal, they are presented the second part of the question, if they select all wrong attribute out of the presented four options, they get zero for the second part, scoring one point for this question. Scenario four - legitimate deal; if the participant correctly selects the snapshot in question as legitimate deal, they are not presented the second part of the question, scoring one point for this question. Scenario five - legitimate deal; if the participant incorrectly selects the snapshot in question as fraudulent deal, they are not presented the second part of the question, scoring zero point for this question. An elaborated example of the scoring is below, below is the image presented to the user when they have completed the demographic entry. Figure 5, is displaying a deal and asking user for if it is fraudulent or legitimate. The user has an option to “click need more info button” if they need more information about this deal to make an informed call.

Result We have performed an analysis to calculate mean pre-scores, mean post-scores. Result highlights: ? The male participants spent more time on the survey which was average 10.054 minutes with average 4.20 clicks on the survey form and had a better overall (preminuspost) score than females, at average of 0.59. ? The female participants spent an average of 8.171 minutes on the survey with average 4.60 clicks on the survey form and had an overall score (preminuspost) average 0.34. ? The age-group 18-25 years had the highest overall score (preminuspost) 1.75 average followed 35-50 years group who scored 0.61 and 0.23 was the average score for 25-25 years participants. ? Victims of fraud, scored better with overall score (preminuspost) of average 1.24 as compared to the non-victims of fraud who had overall score (preminuspost) of average 0.34. The past experience of victims could have been a factor for helping them to score better. ? RoW based participants scored highest overall score (preminuspost) average 1.14 followed by Singapore’s average overall score 0.66 and India’s average overall score 0.16 respectively. ? The post graduates &amp; above had highest overall score (preminuspost) average 0.63 followed by graduates with an average overall score of .52. ? The effect of training was better for Singapore based participants with an average score of 5.70 for pre-training and 6.33 for post training as compared to India based participants with average score of 5.14 pre-training and 5.06 average score post training.

                 Inspection. The visual inspection shows normal data distribution. In the Table 9, for paired samples statistics, by observing the mean value it can be inferred that when the participants took the test without any training on spotting online- shopping fraud attributes they scored an average of 5.43 comparing with a post-training average score of 5.94. This improvement supports our hypothesis, but to ascertain whether this result is significant or due to change, the Paired Samples Test table must be examined. The Std. Deviation in Table 9, shows that the spread of scores in the post-training-test is larger than that in the pre-training-test suggesting the absorption level of training is varying due to the involved human factors.

From the above table, the correlation of our samples is r = 0.326 and p &lt; 0.001. Our participants are therefore behaving consistently as their scores in the post-training are significantly but correlated low with the pre-training scores. Table 4

Correlation Analysis – Clicks, Time and Score In perform further analysis of our hypothesis H2 which draw relationship between the participant’s attentiveness i.e. time spent on the survey and number of clicks on the survey form and eventually the score achieved. Before conducting the right correlation analysis, the prerequisite was to check the linearity of the two variables. We proceeded to test for linearity with the scatter-plot graph. As shown in the Figure 10 and Figure 11 below, there is no linear relationship between the time for completing survey and the PostMinusPre Score and number of clicks and PostMinusPre score either. The graphs didn’t show any monotonic relationship either. Upon visual inspection of the graph, there is no linearity observed between number of clicks,

They were from diverse educational background varying from diploma to post-graduate. The pre-training scores show that majority of the participants were able to identify the online-shopping fraud snapshots even though there was no priming intervention. Most of these participants (126 out of 129) had highlighted in the survey that they had heard about the online-shopping scams and hence they were able to identify some of the online shopping fraud snapshots even before the training. Twelve participants from India shared that the survey could have been better if the shopping deals would have displayed the currency in INR (Indian Rupee), as they had to invest some time in converting the amount displayed in the snapshot, which was in Singapore Dollar, to Indian Rupee. For future studies, it is recommended to design tests with country specific / regional attributes (local currency and local shopping portals) for a better training effect. Seventeen participants, who were victim of online-shopping scams in past, shared their experience on the survey form. Seven participants mentioned buying the articles online, and not receiving them. Two participants highlighted receiving a sub quality product and not the displayed product on the online shopping deal. One participant admitted buying a product online despite of vague product information and not receiving it late. To elaborate the role of the training content and hence the scores we had referred to previous studies by Bramley, which suggests the factors for the training to be effective, the

                 i.e. an online survey platform is conducive to simulate an online-shopping environment, for example, the seller’s profile and detailed disruption of the item were available to the participants by clicking on the relevant buttons of the survey. Bramley went on to mention that when users can see that they can apply the content of training into real environment, it increases the effectiveness of the training (Bramley, 1991). Another probable reason for the good post-training scores in our research could be that the survey platform offered a gamification-based questionnaire, twenty-three of the participants conveyed to the researchers that they found the survey method interesting and they felt like participating in a quiz. Thirty participants had reached out to the researcher mentioning that they thoroughly enjoyed the survey and found the learnings practically applicable. The connectivism theory did work for our training wherein a substantial improvement in the participant’s score was observed. However, there are some principles of connectivism which were not evaluated in our research due to the time constraints, such as “learning is a process of connecting” &amp; “nurturing and maintaining connections are needed for continual learning”.

                 beneficial perspective for better understanding and managing teaching and learning utilizing digital technology, further research and testing are still recommended as it is improbable that a single theory will adequately account for learning in technologically evolving ecommerce scams. The researchers thus highly recommend evaluating other theories for the future experiments (Goldie, 2016). Recommendations We recommend that online shopping platforms should increase customer’s awareness about cybercrime to help educate them and conduct periodic mandatory surveys and trainings to enforce the awareness and thus reduce the occurrence of online shopping scams. Apart from the trainings, we would also recommend that Online stores should also use security certificates and safe payment options to increase the sense of their websites' credibility. Given the online shopping fraud strategies are evolving rapidly, the training attributes are to be revised frequently to deliver similar (or better) results. The future researcher should constantly look-out for new attributes published by local scam-awareness bodies such as police force &amp; security advisory section of online-shopping portals. Based on the feedback received during the survey, the survey should be targeting specific regions (such as a country) and the attributes used i.e. currency and products should be local as well, it helps the participants to better understand the deals and make a well-informed decision. Thus, a global survey has a limitation in terms of consistent outcome across different geography due to the changing attributes as mentioned above. Another feedback received was from the female participants to include apparel related deal snapshot in future research as majority of them had experienced fraud while buying clothes online. Limitation Due to the network effect of researcher, there was a disproportionate participation from one gender, the outcomes could have been more interesting if there was a proportionate participation. Extracting the snapshots of fraudulent deal was a rough process, given the dynamic nature of cyber-crime prevention constantly taking them down and when researcher needed to get additional attributes for training purposes that wasn’t captured before, the deal would be taken down. This resulted in constantly changing the deals till a final attribute list was established. The researcher intended to have global participation for a bigger sample size but the local geographic attributes such as currency, popular articles &amp; scam tactics couldn’t be standardized for a wider global participation, this also surfaced in feedback from participants in India requesting for snapshots in local currency for future similar surveys. The connectivism theory did work for our training wherein a substantial improvement in the participant’s score was observed. However, there are some principles of connectivism which were not evaluated in our research due to the time constraints, such as “learning is a process of connecting” &amp; “nurturing and maintaining connections are needed for continual learning”. The researcher would recommend testing these principles of connectivism by connecting the learners together for a duration for learning purposes and re-evaluate their network-based learning after a period. Future work For future experiments, researchers could look at expanding this survey to focused geographies &amp; snapshots can be extracted from multiple online shopping platforms based on the popularity of the target region. For the online-shopping snapshots, researchers can refer to common / popular scam alerts from the local scam alerting bodies. By expanding the survey outside the current scope, researchers could collect more information on the demographic of the people who do fall prey to online-shopping frauds and observe which groups of individuals are more vulnerable to frauds. With higher participation from 50 years and above, the future researcher may also study the effect of digital divide. The future researchers may also try to study relationship between

Conclusion In this study, we tried to improve the ability of an individual to spot fraudulent online shopping deals. According to our participant demographics, most of them were young adults, with graduation and post-graduation-level education with adequate experience as an internet user – both for personal and professional nature. As such, this group would be one of the most well-suited demographics for learning the techniques of identifying fraudulent online- shopping deals. As reflected in the scores, before our training, most of the participants missed the attributes in the snapshots. Statistical evidence from our experiments suggests that without adequate exposure or training, people are more likely to be misled or fooled by fraudulent online shopping deals. With increasing ecommerce adoption for both consumer and sellers, and unavailability of robust anti-scam measures on prominent online shopping platforms1, the occurrence of online-shopping frauds may increase in future2, hence it is important for constantly evolving online-shopping fraud awareness trainings to protect the end-consumer from frauds. 1Ministry of Home Affairs, Singapore.

The connectivity theory doesn’t argue about the impact of participant’s “attentiveness” on their score and hence it is not as complete as it could be.
